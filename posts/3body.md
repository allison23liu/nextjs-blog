**The Three Body Problem** is super well known but I only finished reading the trilogy over winter break, and I'm happy I did. The concept and execution of the trilogy is so intricate and well-done that I feel like the author must have been tripping on something to have thought of it.

Also, I'm not a physics person so I'm not one to judge, but the people I've talked to who are into physics agree that the theories and ideas discussed throughout the novel are very plausible and aligned with current scientific knowledge, which really reflects Liu Cixin's expertise as an engineer.

I'd highly recmomend this trilogy to anyone interested in sci-fi, and I'm curious if they'll ever end up adapting it to Netflix as the books advertise, especially given US-China relations right now.
