According to Wikipedia, **The Poppy War** is a 2018 novel by R. F. Kuang, published by Harper Voyager. The Poppy War, a grimdark fantasy, draws its plot and politics from mid-20th-century China, with the conflict in the novel based on the Second Sino-Japanese War, and an atmosphere inspired by the Song dynasty.

Although the trilogy was super dark and highkey depressing at times, it was insanely well-written and was a nice balance of character-driven and plot-driven storytelling. I definitely cried many times throughout reading it, and the ending was especially devastating (no spoilers though).

If you're interested in any of the following things, you might also like this book:

Overall, I really enjoyed this trilogy and it definitely took me through an entire emotional rollercoaster that I recommend others experience as well.
